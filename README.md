I have worked on a dataset to apply my high-tech skill in terms of Data Analysis and Visulaization. Here, I am sharing the breif structure of the mentioned dataset, please take a look.
The dataset contains 10 columns and 1,074 rows, representing unicorn companies (startups valued at $1 billion or more). Here's a breakdown of the columns:

**Company**: Name of the unicorn company.
**Valuation**: The company’s valuation in USD (as a string initially).
**Date Joined**: The date the company achieved unicorn status.
